The [Open Traffic Lights](https://opentrafficlights.org)(OTL) [](cite:cites vandevyvere_mepdaw_2019) project proposes a strategy for publishing traffic lights data in a semantical and technical interoperable way. First, with the OTL ontology, global identifiers (URIs) are defined for a subset of the terms of the currently used datastandards SPAT and MAP. SPAT defines the signal phase and timing of a signal group to which a traffic light belongs. MAP defines the geometry of the departure and arrival lanes and how these connections relate to a signal group. By agreeing on the semantics of the terms and applying RDF for describing facts, data publishers are not limited to one datastructure in JSON format. Secondly, OTL defines how the traffic lights data can be published as time sorted [Linked Data Fragments](https://brechtvdv.github.io/Article-Open-Traffic-Lights/#specification). This allows HTTP clients to fetch not only the latest value, but also the historic values through pagination links. In [](#implementation) we will use this knowledge to generate predictions.

Predicting the phase duration has been done in related work [](cite:cites 8500307),[](cite:cites 7325247). In their experiments, tests have been run on traffic lights data with a fixed cycle time. This means that a combination of signal phases occurs repeatedly between fixed time intervals. The intersection in Antwerp, from which we will use the data, has a [variable cycle time](http://docs.wegenenverkeer.be/Publicaties/Brochure%20Verkeerslichtengeregelde%20kruispunten.pdf) between a minimum and maximum time. Depending on the situation of the intersection, signal phases can be extended or shortened which influences its cycle time. However this adds an extra complexity, the ideas of the related work can still be applied. [Ibrahim et al.](cite:cites 8500307) proposes a frequency distribution of the amount of seconds a signal phase takes for every signal phase and fixed cycle time, because an intersection can have  a different fixed cycle time for example during working days, than in the weekend. 
With the frequency distribution, we can calculate the probability $$a$$ that the real phase duration $$d$$ takes longer than the predicted duration $$d_p$$ ($$a = P(d>d_p))$$). By taking the cumulative frequency of durations before the predicted duration $$F(d) = P(dâ‰¤d_p)$$, then we can calculate $$a$$ with the formula: $$a = 1-F(d)$$.
When predicting during a phase, a new distribution frequency needs to be generated keeping only the phase durations that are bigger than the phase duration at that time.
Bodenheimer et al. [](cite:cites 7325247) proposes to create seperate frequency distributions in time slots of 15 minutes and for working and vacation days.
Another method is predicting with a fixed probability [](cite:cites 6965983). The idea is that historical values are a good reflection of future phases, so future phases will correspond with the frequency distribution. A prediction with a certain correctness can be done as follows: it is 90% sure that a phase will be longer than the first 10% of the cumulative frequency distribution and 90% sure that it will take less than the last 10%.
