## Introduction
{:#introduction}

During 2018, the city of Antwerp has invested in connecting the traffic lights controller of one intersection to the Internet. With the Open Traffic Lights project[](cite:cites vandevyvere_mepdaw_2019), these data have been published on the Web as Linked Open Data setting the foundation for reuse. Typically, the phase and timing of a traffic light is used for [Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA)](cite:cites 6799846) systems to save fuel through speed advice or count-down timer [](cite:cites dynamiceco). While GLOSA systems focus on the event of approaching an intersection, route planners have a more global view of the journey where fuel savings is only one parameter. 
Implementing live features like these on the server-side requires a much more complex technology stack than traditional origin-destination route planning queries requiring permanent tracking of the user.
Recently, work has been done on serverless route planning for [public transport](cite:cites colpaert_icwe_2017) and [road networks](colpaert_eswc_demo_2019) performing the route planning algorithm on the client-side. Extending such a client with the consumption of traffic lights data introduces challenges, such as forecasting the phase duration[](cite:cites spat_amsterdam), discovering and integrating traffic lights into the road network of the route planner. Currently, a traffic light update contains an interval when the phase will end. This is problematic for route planners, because they need to know in which the phase will be and for how long when the driver is approaching the intersection. In this article, we investigate how the duration of a live signal phase can be predicted, demonstrate this with the live data from an intersection in Antwerp and discuss how predictions can play a role into the eco-system of serverless route planning interfaces.  

<!-- In this paper, we describe how routeplanners can discover, integrate and predict traffic lights data. First, we describe in related work how traffic lights data are structured and how its phase duration can be predicted. Next, we describe how routeplanners can discover and integrate traffic lights data and how predictions can be made from the Open Traffic Lights data. Then we demonstrate with a  proof-of-concept. -->
