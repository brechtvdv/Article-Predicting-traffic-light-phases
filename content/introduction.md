## Introduction
{:#introduction}

The city of Antwerp invested during 2018 in connecting the traffic lights of an intersection to the Internet. With the Open Traffic Lights (OTL) project [](cite:cites vandevyvere_mepdaw_2019), the data about the phase and timing of these traffic lights are freely available on the Web as Linked Open Data. Typically, this is used for [Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA)](cite:cites 6799846) systems to save fuel through speed advice or count-down timer [](cite:cites dynamiceco). While GLOSA systems focus on the event of approaching an intersection, route planners have a more global view of the user journey where fuel savings can be one parameter. 
Implementing live changing data like these in traditional origin-destination route planning APIs would require much more complex tasks such as permanent tracking of the user.
Recently, work has been done on serverless route planning over [public transport timetables](cite:cites colpaert_icwe_2017) and [road networks](cite:cites colpaert_eswc_demo_2019) performing the route planning algorithm on the client-side. Extending such a client with the consumption of traffic lights data introduces new challenges such as forecasting the phase duration [](cite:cites spat_amsterdam). Dynamic traffic lights, like the one in Antwerp, change their current phase duration according to the crowdedness, detecting pedestrians, emergency situations etc. which makes the data difficult to reuse for route planning. 
In this article, we describe how predicting the phase duration has been done in related work ([](#sota)) and apply this for the intersection in Antwerp.
