## Abstract
Traffic lights with a variable phase duration are widely used for optimizing traffic flows. Although the minimum and maximum duration of a phase is published, a predicted duration with a certain confidence would increase the reusability of traffic lights data for route planners.
We tested for a live Open traffic lights dataset of Antwerp (i) how frequency distributions of phase durations can be used to predict the duration of the current phase and (ii) how frequency distributions can be created client-side and on-the-fly with a demonstrator.
An overall mean average error (MAE) of 5.1 seconds is reached by grouping the phase durations per day and in time slots of 20 minutes and using the median to select a predicted phase duration. When taking the time until end of phase into account, we see for the bulk of phases that the MAE is flattening around 10 seconds, but grows linear for outliers. 
With our approach, route planners can calculate how long the current phase will take by using frequency distributions. In future work, we will investigate how traffic lights data can be integrated into road network graphs and how other Open Datasets (crowdedness counters, public transport...) can be reused to detect the outlying phase durations.
