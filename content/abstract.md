## Abstract
Dynamic traffic lights change their current phase duration according to the situation on the intersection, such as crowdedness. In Flanders, only the minimum and maximum duration of the current phase is published. When route planners want to reuse this data they have to predict how long the current phase will take in order to route over these traffic lights. 
We tested for a live Open Traffic Lights dataset of Antwerp how frequency distributions of phase durations (i) can be used to predict the duration of the current phase and (ii) can be created client-side and on-the-fly with a demonstrator.
An overall mean average error (MAE) of 5.1 seconds is reached by using the median for predictions. A distribution is created for every time slot of 20 minutes and per day. This is better than expected, because phase durations can have a spectrum between a few seconds and over two minutes.
When taking the remaining time until the phase changes into account, we see a MAE flattening around 10 seconds when the remaining time is less than a minute. As most phases take less than a minute, route planning over traffic lights underneath a minute becomes feasible.  
Unfortunately, the MAE grows linear for phases longer than a minute making our prediction method useless. 
In future work, we investigate how other Open Datasets (crowdedness counters, public transport...) can be reused to find correlations with these exceptionally long phase durations. This way, the prediction error could be bounded to a certain level leaving very high error rates only for real emergencies.
