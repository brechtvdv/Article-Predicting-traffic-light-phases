## Abstract
Traffic lights with a variable phase duration are widely used to optimize traffic flows. Although the minimum and maximum duration of a phase is already published, route planners need a predicted duration with a certain confidence for routing decisions.
We tested for a live Open traffic lights dataset of Antwerp (i) how frequency distributions of phase durations can be used for predicting and (ii) how this could work client-side by creating frequency distributions on-the-fly.
A mean average error (MAE) of 5.1 seconds is observed by grouping the phase durations in fine-grained time slots and using the median to select a predicted phase duration. Also we see that the MAE is flattening around 10s for phase durations below 62s and starts growing linear after that. 
With our approach, route planners can have a good indication of the current phase duration for the bulk of phases. In future work, we will look into how client-side route planners can integrate traffic lights data into their road network graph and how other Open Datasets can be reused to detect the more exceptionally longer phase durations.
